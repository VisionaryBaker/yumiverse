# yumiverse
"I'm building a mobile app called Yumiverse using React Native and Node.js. It's a social cooking platform that allows users to share recipes, engage in cooking challenges, and connect with other food enthusiasts globally. Can you help me set up the basic file structure for this project and create a simple 'Hello World' app in React Native?"
